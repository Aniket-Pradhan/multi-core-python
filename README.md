# Multi-Core-Python
Here you will find simple python 2.7 files which demonstrate a pattern for workig with multi-core processors.

These files and instructions are based on work with a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B running Debian Jessie but the general pattern should work on other systems with a multi-core processor.

For a detailed discussion of the ues of these files see the blog post "Easy muiti-core programming with Python" at:
